## SLIDE 1: TITLE
**AI-Powered Dynamic Pricing for Renty**  
*Revenue Optimization Through Real-Time Intelligence*

[Your Name] - 3 Weeks at Renty  
[Date]

**Opening Line:**  
*"In 3 weeks, I've built an AI system that can increase our revenue by 10-15% while giving managers real-time, data-driven pricing recommendations."*

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM & SOLUTION

**Today's Challenge:**
- Manual pricing across 6+ branches
- No visibility into competitor rates
- Missing revenue during peak demand
- Empty fleet during low periods
- **Cost: 10-15% revenue leakage annually**

**The Solution:**
- AI predicts demand (96.5% accuracy)
- Live competitor intelligence (updated daily)
- Smart pricing rules (demand + supply + events)
- Manager dashboard (one-click decisions)

**Result: Right price, right time, every time**

---

## SLIDE 3: HOW IT WORKS - SIMPLE

**The Formula:**
```
Final Price = Base Price × Demand × Supply × Events
```

**Real Example:**
- Economy car base: 100 SAR
- Monday demand: Normal (1.0)
- 75% fleet rented: Low supply (1.1) 
- No events: (1.0)
- **Final: 110 SAR (+10%)**

**When We Discount:** Low utilization, normal demand → Save costs, drive bookings  
**When We Premium:** High utilization, peak demand → Maximize revenue

**The AI learns your patterns and recommends optimal prices automatically**
