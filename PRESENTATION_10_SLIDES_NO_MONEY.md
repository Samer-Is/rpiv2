## SLIDE 1: TITLE
**AI-Powered Dynamic Pricing for Renty**  
*Intelligent Revenue Optimization Through Real-Time Data*

[Your Name] - 3 Weeks at Renty  
[Date]

**Opening Line:**  
*"In 3 weeks, I've built an AI system that gives branch managers real-time, data-driven pricing recommendations with 96.5% accuracy."*

---

## SLIDE 2: THE CHALLENGE WE'RE SOLVING

**Today's Reality:**
- Manual pricing decisions across 6+ branches
- No visibility into competitor rates
- Prices set weekly, market changes daily
- Guesswork instead of data
- Inconsistent pricing across locations

**What We Need:**
- Real-time market intelligence
- Automated demand forecasting
- Smart pricing recommendations
- Competitive positioning insights
- Transparent, explainable decisions

**The Goal: Make pricing a strategic advantage, not a daily headache**

---

## SLIDE 3: HOW DYNAMIC PRICING WORKS

**The Concept:**
```
Optimal Price = Base Price × Demand Factor × Supply Factor × Event Factor
```

**Real Example:**
- Economy car: 100 SAR base price
- **Demand:** AI predicts normal Monday (1.0)
- **Supply:** 75% fleet rented, low availability (1.1)
- **Events:** No holidays today (1.0)
- **Result:** 110 SAR (+10% premium)

**Different Scenarios:**

| Situation | Demand | Supply | Events | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Low season + empty fleet | 0.9 | 0.9 | 1.0 | **Discount** to drive bookings |
| Normal day + busy fleet | 1.0 | 1.1 | 1.0 | **Small premium** |
| Hajj + full fleet | 1.2 | 1.15 | 1.3 | **Peak pricing** |

**The system learns your patterns and adapts automatically**
